U-2022.12 Updates
=====================
* Added support for running legalization during the placement operation of create_power.tcl
  - If CREATE_POWER_OPERATIONS is specified with "STDCELL_PLACEMENT" (RM default),
    after create_placement is done, the script now runs a new command rm_legalize_placement, which legalizes the standard cell placement.
    This allows the running of check_legality, check_pg_connectivity, and check_pg_drc for checking legalization and PG issues.
